# Encryption Algorithm

This program can be used to encrypt an input text using various types of encrpytion. Rijndael's Galois field multiplication, Vigenere tables, and a few other methods are used. Check out the PDF explanation in this repo for a detailed description of the full process. 

Each portion of the encryption process is thoroughly commented in the code file, so feel free to take a look.
